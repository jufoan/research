### Research Tasks (Issues)
Research Tasks are under the issues tab above. 

You can scan the list of issues and look for a blank assignment column to know which issues have not been claimed. Click on an issue to see the details for that issue.

To claim an issue, just write a comment like "I'll take it," after you see that no one else has written such a comment. When you write a comment, you will be subscribed to emails showing any activity on the issue.

When I see the comment, as soon as possible I will assign the issue to you. There is no need to wait until I do that to start your research.

When you complete your research on an issue, write your results in a comment. When I see that, I will write another comment, or close the issue, or both.
