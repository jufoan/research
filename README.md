### Research Tasks (Issues)
Research Tasks are under the issues tab above. 

You can scan the list of issues and look for the tag "help wanted" or a blank assignment column to know which issues have not been claimed. Click on an issue to see the details for that issue.

To claim an issue, just write a comment like "I'll take it," after you see that no one else has written such a comment. When you write a comment, you will be subscribed to emails showing any activity on the issue.

When I see the comment, as soon as possible I will assign the issue to you. There is no need to wait until I do that to start your research.

Comments can be used to ask questions, or discuss the issue.

When you complete your research on an issue, write your results in a comment. There is no need to use the "((" notation, just provide some comments with links. When I see your comment, I will write another comment, or close the issue, or both.
